Question 1
============

We need to modulate a wave in order to use it to encode data.

In Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) we modify the amplitude of a wave to encode bits. For instance, we could encode a 1 as sending a fixed-size wave for T time, and a 0 as sending nothing for T time.

In Phase Shift Keying (PSK) we modify the phase of a wave to encode bits. For instance, we could encode a 1 with a phase starting at the top of a wave and a 0 with a phase starting at the bottom of a wave.

Noise and interference has a smaller impact.

Question 2
============

1

802.11 uses CSMA/CA. Collision detection is performed by the sender. Because of the hidden terminal problem, the sender might not see the same signals as the receiver, which means that it isn't possible for the sender to detect collisions, thereby making collision detection infeasible. The exposed terminal problem also causes problems w.r.t. using CD since a sender could detect collisions which aren't interfering with his own transmission, meaning he wouldn't transmit even though he "should".


2
---
Yes, RTS/CTS helps against the hidden terminal problems.
It helps because the receiver, whom it is assumed can be heard by everybody, announces who is allowed to send to him. This has the effect that everyone who might send to the receiver will receive the CTS, letting them know not to transmit to him again until the size described in the CTS has had time to be transmitted.

Yes, RTS/CTS helps against the exposed terminal problem as well.
Assume that B and C want to send data to A and D, respectively. A is not in range of C, and D is not in range of B. This means that both B and C can transmit their data without interfering with each other's transmission.

    A <- B    C -> D

C will overhear B sending an RTS to A, but not hear A's CTS. From this, C can infer that he is not in range of A, meaning that he can safely transmit to D. This assumes symmetric transmission distance between A and C.

The residual backoff timer is used as a fairness-mechanism.
When terminals detect an ongoing transmission on the shared media, they have to wait for a fixed (DIFS) plus a random amount of time before again sensing the media. In order to make the waiting more fair, i.e. the longer a terminal has waited, the more likely it is to get to use the media, the terminals don't pick a new random time whenever the medium is busy, but "work on" the same timer until it expires.

Question 3
============

1

Assuming that we want to promise a certain quality of each phone call (i.e. a minimum bandwidth), I'd pick fixed TDMA. Using fixed TDMA we can promise all users the same bandwidth. This solution is not very bandwidth efficient if only a few users are using it, but on the other hand the quality of service of this system would not degrade as the number of users reaches the maximum because there is no contention for slots. Once the maximum is reached there can be no more users on the system since the bandwidth would be fully utilized, and there would be no more free time slots.

Besides polled TDMA generally being used in Bluetooth, it has two variations hereof: Synchronous Connection Oriented (SCO) and Asynchronous Connection Less (ACL).

In SCO, a certain bandwidth is reserved for a slave. The master will poll the slave at a rate giving him the reserved bandwidth.
In ACL, the master polls terminals in a round-robin fashion, asking them for the amount of data they want to transfer. The slaves may request to send up to 5 slots worth of data.

Because of the promised quality of service that SCO can deliver, it is most often used for voice, while ACL is more often used for transferring files.

B-MAC sends a very large preamble before each packet (about the time of a sleep-cycle), in order to make sure that possible receivers are awake and aware of the coming data transmission. If there isn't a lot of payload to be transmitted, the preamble might make up a substantial part of the total data transmitted. This means that a substantial time (and power) is spent sending "unnecessary" data, yielding a low payload-to-power ratio.
